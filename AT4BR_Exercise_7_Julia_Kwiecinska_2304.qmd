## Bad plot

In the last homework I used the plot from TVP "health care expenditure as % of GDP" from June 7, 2021

![plotpng](pictures/plot1.png)

Publication of this plot strangely enough was shown during the protest of nurses. The purpose of this chart was simple -- to present heath care spending in a favourable light after 2015 (when the right-wing populist Law and Justice (PiS) party won the Polish parliamentary election). There are 4 manipulations in one picture:

-   The Y axis was scaled from 4% to emphasize the contrast. Thanks to this, visually 6% is twice as large as 5%, and the same case goes to 5% being two times bigger than 4.5%.

-   The bars on the right side (6% and 7%) are crucial for the reception of the chart and are only the growth planned for 2023 and 2027, so forecasts!

-   The years 2017, 2018 and 2019 have been removed from the chart, when the growth was not so spectacular.

-   Different colours of the 2009-2015 and 2016-2027 bars emphasize the false contrast between parties.

## Loading the data

We do not have to simulate the data because it is real and available, and you can access it, for example, here: https://stat.gov.pl/. So we just need to form a table with years and values.

```{r}
table <- data.frame(
  Year = c(2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021),
  Value = c(4.8, 4.7, 4.5, 4.4, 4.5, 4.4, 4.5, 4.5, 4.6, 4.5, 4.9, 5.0, 5.3)
)

table
```

## Fix the plot

First, let's load the library:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Now, let's fix the plot with ggplot.

-   Factor(Year) helped me with assigning each Year to each bar.

-   With scale_y_continuous I added second axis on the left and changed the default breaks between the values on y axis - it was 0, 2, 4, 6... and after the change - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...

-   Label = paste0(value, "%") allowed me to label each bar above it with vjust = -0.5.

-   Element_text(face = "bold") helped me to get my title be bold.

```{r}
ggplot(table, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Value))+
  geom_bar(fill = "darkgreen", stat = "identity", width = 0.8)+
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~., breaks = seq(0,6, by = 1)), 
                     breaks = seq(0,6, by = 1))+
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Value,"%")), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Health care expenditure as % of GDP", 
       subtitle = "In Poland, 2009 - 2021", x = "Year", y ="Percent of GDP") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(
    face = "bold"
  ))
```
